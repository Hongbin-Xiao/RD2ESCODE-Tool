Requirement document: 8051 microcontroller based solar auto-tracking system
1. Project Overview
This system is designed based on 8051 series microcontroller (e.g. AT89C51), which detects the ambient light intensity through the photoresistor sensor and realises the automatic tracking control of solar panels. The system supports manual and automatic dual-mode operation, and is able to adjust the horizontal and vertical angles of the solar panel according to the direction of the light source to maximise the efficiency of light energy absorption. The core functions include sensor data acquisition, stepper motor drive, abnormal status indication and human-computer interaction control, which is suitable for light source tracking scenarios of solar power generation equipment.

Non-functional Requirements

Tracking accuracy: Light intensity difference tolerance range ±15 (configurable), stop fine-tuning when the difference is less than 4 (vertical)/7 (horizontal).

Response speed: stepper motor drive cycle 2.5ms, ensuring smooth and jitter-free rotation.

Sensor sampling rate: ADC data is updated ≥100 times per second.

Abnormal recovery: The system automatically exits the error state after the sensor returns to normal.

Hardware constraints

Main control chip: AT89C51 microcontroller, 12MHz crystal.

Sensor module: 4-channel photoresistor (connected to PCF8591 ADC chip), detection range 0-5V.

Actuator: 2-way four-phase stepping motor, respectively control horizontal and vertical direction.

Human-machine interface: 5 independent buttons (mode switching, up/down/right/left control), 2 LED status indicators.

Reliability requirements

Operating temperature range: -20℃~70℃.

Continuous operation time: ≥24×7 hours.

Key Logic

Auto-tracking algorithm:

Vertical direction: Compare the upper and lower photoresistor values (AD0 vs AD1) and adjust the motor direction when the difference is ≥15.

Horizontal direction: compare left and right photoresistor values (AD2 vs AD3), adjust motor direction when the difference is ≥15.

Stepper motor control:

Use 8-phase drive sequence (e.g. 0x01, 0x03, 0x02...), output cyclically via timer interrupt (2.5ms).

Exception handling:

Dual LEDs flash alarm at 1Hz when the photoresistor value is out of the 0-255 range.
