1. Project overview
This system is designed based on 8051 series microcontroller (e.g. AT89C51). It collects real-time ambient temperature through DS18B20 digital temperature sensor and displays the current temperature value (unit: ℃) on two common anode digital tube. The system controls the start and stop status of 4 fans (f1-f4) according to the preset temperature threshold to achieve multi-level temperature control cooling, which is suitable for machine rooms, industrial equipment and other scenarios that require dynamic cooling management.

F2 Multi-stage fan control Temperature value exceeds preset threshold Fan starts and stops according to rules (see Table 1)
F3 Temperature data calibration Sensor initialisation and data reading Temperature value error ≤±0.5°C

Temperature range Fan status (f1-f4) Control description
T < 20°C f1=1, f2=1, f3=0, f4=1 Fan 3 on only (low load cooling)
30°C ≤ T < 40°C f1=1, f2=0, f3=0, f4=1 Switch off fan 2, keep fan 3 running
50℃ ≤ T < 60℃ f1=0, f2=0, f3=0, f4=1 switch off fan 1 and 2, only fan 3 full speed operation
T ≥ 60°C f1=0, f2=0, f3=0, f4=0 All fans on full speed (emergency cooling mode)
Notes:

Fan control logic: 0 means fan on, 1 means fan off (according to the code of low level effective design).

Temperature range design: Increase the heat dissipation intensity step by step to avoid frequent start and stop.

Hardware constraints

Main control chip: AT89C51 microcontroller, 12MHz crystal.

Sensor module: DS18B20 single-bus temperature sensor, connected to P1.0, external 4.7kΩ pull-up resistor required.

Key Logic

Temperature Acquisition: Communicate with DS18B20 via single bus protocol (1-Wire) to read 12-bit temperature data.

Data processing: Convert raw data to decimal temperature value (e.g. 0x0190 → 25.0°C).

Fan control: according to the logic of Table 1, adjust the fan start-stop state step by step to ensure the balance of cooling efficiency and energy consumption.
