Electronic Combination Lock System Requirements Document
1. System Overview
This system is based on a 51 microcontroller (AT89x52) and implements an electronic combination lock with a six-digit digital tube display. The core functions include:

Password Input and Verification: Input the 6-digit digital password through the 4x4 matrix keypad, the system verifies the correctness of the password and then controls the electronic lock switch.

Password management: support for changing the default password (initial password 123456), the new password needs to be set through the keyboard.

Status display: six-digit digital tube real-time display of the input status (-- instead of the actual number), correct password prompt (888888) or error prompt (FFFFFFF).

Security alarm: triggers buzzer alarm and locks the input when the password is wrong.

Lock control function: control the electronic lock switch by relay (low level active).

2. Detailed Functional Requirements
2.1 Keyboard Module
4x4 matrix keyboard layout:

Key Function Key Value Corresponding P3 Pin Status
1, 2, 3 1-3 P3=0xfb Scan line
4, 5, 6 4-6 P3=0xfd scan line
7, 8, 9 7-9 P3=0xfe scan line
0, Set, Delete, Reset 0/Set/Delete/Reset P3=0xf7 scan line
Function Description:

Numeric key (0-9): input password, digital tube display when inputting - hide the actual number.

Setting key (*): long press to enter password change mode, input new password and press confirm key to save.

Delete key (#): Delete the entered password bit by bit.

Reset key: clear all inputs and reset system status.

2.2 Display Module
Six-digit digital tube:

Segment select code: common cathode digital tube, output segment code through P0 port (e.g. 0x3f displays the number 0).

Bit Selection Code: Select the currently displayed digit through P2 port (e.g. 0xfe selects the first bit).

Display logic:

Input status: display -- (segment code 0x40) when input.

Correct password: display 888888 (segment code 0x7f).

Wrong password: display FFFFFFF (segment code 0x71) and trigger alarm.

2.3 Password Management Module
Password storage:

Default password: pws[6] = {1,2,3,4,5,6}.

User input password: pwx[6] stores temporary input.

Password validation:

Function compare() compares pws and pwx bit by bit, returns rightflag=1 when it is exactly the same.

2.4 Alarm and Control Module
Buzzer alarm:

Trigger condition: when the password is wrong or the number of input digits is not enough, the buzzer will beep at high frequency (Beep = P1^2).

Lock relay:

Password correct: P1_0 = 0 (lock open), P1_1 = 1.

Wrong password: P1_1 = 0 (lock off).

3. Pin Definitions
Peripheral Module Pin Definition Function
Digital tube P0 segment selection signal (common cathode)
P2 Bit select signal (6-bit independent control)
Matrix Keypad P3 4x4 keypad row and column scan (low 4 bits for row, high 4 bits for column)
Buzzer Beep = P1^2 Alarm signal output
Relay P1_0 Lock-on control (active low)
P1_1 Lock-off control (active high)
Indicator P1_3 Password setting mode indicator
4. Function Verification
4.1 Password Input and Verification Test
Test Steps:

Input the default password 123456 and press the confirmation button.

Observe whether the digital tube displays 888888 and whether the relay is engaged (locked open).

Input wrong password (e.g. 111111), check whether it displays FFFFFFF and triggers the buzzer.

Expected result: lock open when the password is correct, alarm and lock when it is wrong.

4.2 Password Change Test
Test steps:

Press and hold the setup button to enter the modification mode, enter the new password (e.g. 654321) and press the confirmation button to save.

Re-enter the new password to verify whether it can be unlocked.

Expected result: new password takes effect, old password is invalid.

4.3 Exception Handling Test
Test Steps:

Input the 5-digit password and press the confirmation key to check whether the alarm is triggered.

Input the wrong password 3 times consecutively and observe whether the system is locked or not.

Expected Result: Trigger alarm and lock the keypad when inputting insufficient digits or multiple errors.

5. Numerical or formula calculation function
5.1 Digital Pipe Segment Code Conversion
Segment code table (common cathode)

unsigned char code tabledu[] = {0x3f, 0x06, 0x5b, 0x4f, 0x66, 0x6d, 0x7d, 0x07, 0x7f, 0x6f, 0x00, 0x40}; // Corresponding to numbers 0-9, 0x7f, 0x6f, 0x00, 0x40}; // Corresponding to numbers 0-9.  
// Corresponds to the numbers 0-9, full extinction (0x00), horizontal bar (0x40).  
5.2 Dynamic Display Refresh
Timer interrupt function:


void timer0() interrupt 1 {  
  for(i=0; i<6; i++) {  
    P0 = workbuf[i]; // output segment code  
    P2 = tablewe[i]; // select bit code  
    delay(5); P0 = 0; // cancel the segment code.  
    P0 = 0; // mask  
  }  
}  
Explanation: Refresh one digit every 500Î¼s to realise 6-bit dynamic display.

5.3 Password Verification Logic
Code snippet:

bit compare() {  
  if (pwx[0]==pws[0] && pwx[1]==pws[1] && ... && pwx[5]==pws[5])  
    rightflag = 1;  
  pwx[5]==pws[5]) rightflag = 1; else  
    rightflag = 0; return rightflag; return rightflag  
  return rightflag.  
}  
Remarks:

The default password needs to be modified by code, and it is recommended to add EEPROM storage function for power failure saving.

Relay control logic needs to be matched with the actual hardware (e.g. level polarity of lock on/off).
