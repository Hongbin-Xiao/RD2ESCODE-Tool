PM2.5 Monitoring System Requirements Documentation
1. System Overview
This system is based on 51 microcontroller for real-time monitoring of PM2.5 concentration in the environment and displaying data, alarm thresholds and status via LCD. The core functions include:

PM2.5 concentration detection: the sensor analogue signal is collected by ADC0832 and converted to digital value (0-255).

Real-time display: LCD1602 displays current PM2.5 concentration (PM2.5: XXX ug/m³) and alarm threshold (ALARM: XXX ug/m³) in two lines.

Threshold Alarm: When the PM2.5 concentration exceeds the preset threshold, it triggers the buzzer, relay (to control external devices) and LED indicator.

User Interaction: Set alarm threshold by keypad, support increment/decrement operation.

2. Detailed Functional Requirements
2.1 Sensor Module
ADC0832

Function: 8-bit ADC chip, collects analogue signals from PM2.5 sensor and outputs 0-255 raw values.

Conversion formula:


DA = adc0832(0); // read the original value of channel 0
2.2 Display module (LCD1602)
Display content:

First line: real-time PM2.5 concentration (format PM2.5: XXX ug/m³).

Second line: alarm threshold (format ALARM: XXX ug/m³).

Display control:

Support dynamic update value, clear screen, cursor control (display cursor in setting mode).

2.3 Key Module
Key Definition:

SET_KEY (P3^4): function key, switch normal mode/setting mode.

ADD_KEY (P3^5): add key, increase threshold in setting mode (step 10).

SUB_KEY (P3^6): minus key, decreases the threshold in setting mode (step 10).

Operation flow:

Press SET_KEY to enter setting mode, LCD displays cursor and buzzer beeps briefly.

Adjust the threshold value (range 0-255ug/m³) by ADD_KEY/SUB_KEY.

Press SET_KEY again to save and exit the setting mode.

2.4 Alarm Module
Trigger condition:

PM2.5 concentration ≥ alarm threshold (WARNING, default 200 ug/m³).

Response action:

Buzzer (BUZZ = P3^7): beeps at 1Hz.

LED Indicator:

Red LED (LED_RED = P2^2): illuminates when the concentration exceeds the limit.

Yellow LED (LED_YELLOW = P2^1): illuminates when the concentration is between 50% and 100% of the threshold.

Green LED (LED_GREEN = P2^0): illuminates when the concentration is below 50% of the threshold.

Relay (jdq = P2^4): closes when the concentration exceeds the threshold (active low).

4. Functional verification
4.1 Display Function Verification
Test Steps:

Observe whether the LCD displays the initial interface (PM2.5: 0 ug/m³, ALARM: 200 ug/m³) after powering up.

Using a PM2.5 analogue source, check that the real-time concentration values are updated (e.g. PM2.5: 150 ug/m³).

Expected result: LCD correctly displays real-time data and threshold values without garbled codes.

4.2 Key Function Verification
Test Steps:

Press SET_KEY to enter the setting mode and observe whether the LCD cursor is displayed.

Press ADD_KEY to adjust the threshold value from 200 to 220, and check whether the display on the second line is updated to ALARM: 220 ug/m³.

Press SUB_KEY to adjust the threshold back to 200, confirm save and exit the setting mode.

Expected result: the threshold value is adjusted accurately and takes effect after saving.

4.3 Alarm Function Verification
Test Steps:

Set the threshold value to 100 ug/m³ and artificially increase the PM2.5 concentration to 150 ug/m³.

Check whether the red LED lights up, the buzzer sounds and the relay is closed.

Decrease the concentration to 80 ug/m³, check if the yellow LED lights up and the alarm stops.

Expected result: Alarm triggering and stopping are in accordance with logic, and each device responds normally.

5. Numerical or formula calculation function
5.1 Conversion of PM2.5 concentration
Code snippet (dht.c):

DA = adc0832(0); // read ADC raw value (0-255)
Formula Description:

Assuming a non-linear relationship between ADC raw value and PM2.5 concentration, the current formula is empirically calibrated (needs to be adjusted according to sensor specifications).


Remarks:

The ADC conversion formula needs to be recalibrated according to the actual sensor output characteristics, and it is recommended to use standard PM2.5 detection equipment for calibration.

Relay control logic (jdq=0 is closed) needs to be matched with the actual hardware circuit.
