Requirements document: 8051 microcontroller-based real-time clock and alarm system
1. Project Overview
This system is designed based on 8051 series microcontroller (e.g. STC89C52), providing high-precision time data through DS1302 real-time clock chip, supporting time display, manual calibration, alarm setting and triggering functions. The system displays the time (year, month, day, week, hour, minute, second) in real time through LCD1602 display, and the alarm time and switch state can be set through the keypad, and the alarm configuration is saved to the internal EEPROM of the microcontroller, which ensures that it will not be lost in case of power failure. The buzzer module is used for the sound prompt when the alarm clock is triggered, which is suitable for home, office and other scenarios that require time management.

2. Function Requirements
Function No. Function Description Input/Trigger Condition Output/Response Result
F1 Real-time time display The system runs automatically on power-up LCD displays the current time (format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS )
F2 Manual time calibration Press setting key (P3.2) to enter time setting mode, support year, month, day of the week, hour, minute and second adjustment.
F3 Alarm setting and saving Press alarm key (P3.3) to set alarm time (hour, minute) and switch state, save to EEPROM.
F4 Alarm Clock Trigger Match the current time with the alarm time Buzzer beeps at 0.2Hz and continues until manually switched off or timeout.
F5 Key de-jittering process Hardware delay de-jittering when key is pressed to avoid false trigger.
F6 Abnormal time recovery DS1302 not initialised Auto write default time (2016-08-05 16:30:50)

4.2 Software Design
Main programme flow

plaintext
Copy
Initialisation → read DS1302 time → enter main loop.  
  1. Refresh LCD display  
  2. Detect key input:  
     - Setting key: enter time calibration mode  
     - Alarm key: Enter alarm setting mode  
  3. Check the alarm trigger condition  
  4. 100ms delay time → repeat cycle  
Key Logic

Time calibration:

User adjusts the year, month, day of the week, hour, minute and second by plus and minus keys, and write to DS1302 after confirmation.

Data format conversion: Decimal ↔ BCD code (e.g. ‘16’ → 0x16).

Alarm clock saving:

Alarm clock time (hour, minute) and switch state are saved to EEPROM address 0x2000-0x2002.

Data checking is performed when reading (hour ≤ 23, minute ≤ 59, switch state 0/1).

Buzzer control:

When the alarm is triggered, the buzzer sounds at a frequency of 0.2Hz (0.1 second on, 0.1 second off), and continues until the user presses the key or stops automatically after 59 seconds.

5. Test Verification
Test item Expected result Passing standard
Time display initialisation LCD display default time (2016-08-05 16:30:50) Time format and value are correct
Manual time calibration The adjusted time is written into DS1302 and displayed The measured time is the same as the set value, and the error is ≤1 second.
Alarm clock setting and saving Restart the system after setting the alarm time, the configuration will not be lost EEPROM readout value is the same as the set value.
Alarm trigger Arrive at the set time buzzer buzzer at a frequency of 0.2Hz, continuous to the operation
Key Response The system responds instantly when the key is pressed, no delay, repeated triggering or missed detection.
6. Dependencies
Hardware Dependencies

DS1302 clock module, LCD1602 display, 5V regulated power supply.

Buzzer, key module, STC89C52 development board.

Software dependencies

Keil C51 development environment, supporting 8051 instruction set and timer interrupt configuration.

DS1302 driver library (requires custom SPI communication logic).

7. Limitations and Extensions
Current Limitations

Only support 24-hour system, no 12-hour system switching function.

Alarm clock only supports single group time setting, does not support multiple groups of alarm clocks.

Expansion direction

Add temperature display: integrate DS18B20 temperature sensor, expand ambient temperature display function.

Multi-alarm clock support: Expand storage space through EEPROM, support setting more than 3 groups of alarm clock.

Wireless synchronisation: add Bluetooth module, support mobile phone APP to synchronise time and alarm clock setting.
