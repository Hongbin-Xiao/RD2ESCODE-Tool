# Requirements Document: 8051 Microcontroller-Based LED Flow Light Control System

## 1. Project Overview
This system is developed based on the 8051 series microcontroller (such as STC89C52) to achieve a flowing light effect with 8 LEDs by controlling GPIO port output level changes. The system illuminates LEDs sequentially at a fixed frequency, creating a visual dynamic flowing effect.

## 2. Functional Requirements
| Function ID | Function Description | Input/Trigger Condition | Output/Response Result |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| F1 | LED flowing light cycle | Automatic operation upon power-up | 8 LEDs light up sequentially |
| F2 | Single light movement interval control | Built-in 150ms delay parameter | Light switches once every 150ms |

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
### Performance Requirements
- LED refresh rate: approximately 6.67 Hz (each LED maintains for 150ms)

### Hardware Constraints
- Microcontroller model: Compatible with 8051 architecture
- Port requirements: P0 port requires external current-limiting resistors (typical values 220Ω-1kΩ)
- LED driving method: Low level active (common anode connection)

## 4. System Design
### Hardware Design
| Module | Configuration Description |
|--------|---------------------------|
| Main controller | STC89C52RC (12MHz crystal oscillator) |
| LED array | 8-bit common anode LED module connected to P0 port |
| Power supply | 5V DC ±5% |

### Software Design
#### Main Program Flow
```
Start → P0 initialization → Enter main loop:
   1. Rotate P0 port data left
   2. Delay 150ms
   3. Repeat loop
```

```
// Rotate left function
P0 = _crol_(P0, 1);  // Rotate left 1 bit each time
```

## 5. Test Verification
| Test Item | Expected Result | Pass Criteria |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Power-on initialization | LED1 lights up, others off | P0=0xFE (11111110b) |
| First shift | LED2 lights up, others off | P0=0xFD (11111101b) |
| Cycle period test | Complete 8-LED cycle period = 1200ms±5% | Measured value 1200ms±60ms |

```c
_crol_()        // Circular left rotation function from intrins.h
DelayMS(150)    // Actual delay ≈150ms (12MHz clock)
```

### LED Status Table
| Step | P0 Value (HEX) | LED Position |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| 0 | 0xFE | LED1 |
| 1 | 0xFD | LED2 |
| ... | ... | ... |
| 7 | 0x7F | LED8 |
