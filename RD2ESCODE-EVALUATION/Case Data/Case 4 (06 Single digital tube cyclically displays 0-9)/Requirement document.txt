Requirement Document: Digital Tube Cyclic Display System Based on 8051 Microcontroller

### System Overview
This system is developed based on the 8051 series microcontroller (e.g., STC89C52) and drives a single common-cathode digital tube to cyclically display numbers 0-9 by controlling the segment code data output through the P0 port. The system automatically switches the display content at fixed time intervals (200ms) to create a dynamic numeric increment effect, suitable for basic numeric display scenarios such as counters and timers.

### Core Function Description

#### Display Function
- **Numeric Cyclic Display**: The digital tube sequentially displays numbers 0 to 9, with each number staying visible for 200ms before automatically switching to the next number.
- **Segment Code Control Logic**:
  - A predefined segment code table `DSY_CODE[]` stores the common-anode encoding for numbers 0-9.
  - The statement `P0=~DSY_CODE[i]` inverts the segment codes to match the voltage requirements of the common-cathode digital tube (high level lights up the segments).

#### Hardware Configuration
- **Main Control Chip**: STC89C52RC microcontroller with a 12MHz crystal oscillator providing the clock reference.
- **Digital Tube Interface**:
  - The P0 port directly drives the digital tube segment codes (a~dp pins), with external 220Ω current-limiting resistors to protect the LED segments.
  - **Digital Tube Type**: Single common-cathode digital tube (e.g., 5161BS).
- **Power Requirements**: 5V DC power supply, with the total system operating current ≤20mA.

#### Software Logic
- **Cyclic Control**: The variable `i` increments from 0 to 9 and then automatically resets to 0, achieving numeric cycling (`i=(i+1)%10`).
- **Delay Mechanism**: The `DelayMS(200)` function uses nested loops to achieve approximately 200ms delay, controlling the display switching speed.
- **Initialization Settings**: At program startup, `P0=0x00` is set to ensure the digital tube's initial state is completely off.

> Note: The digital tube must be of the common-cathode type to match the inverted segment code logic.
