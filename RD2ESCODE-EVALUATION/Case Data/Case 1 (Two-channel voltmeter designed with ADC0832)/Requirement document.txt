Requirement Document: Dual-Channel Digital Voltmeter System Based on ADC0832

This system is designed based on the 8051 microcontroller (e.g., AT89C51) and utilizes the ADC0832 analog-to-digital conversion chip to collect two channels of analog voltage signals (0-5V). After converting the signals into digital values, the system displays them in real time on an LCD or digital tube. The hardware core includes the main control chip, ADC0832 (communicating via SPI protocol through the P1 port), an LCD display module (e.g., 16x2 character screen), and peripheral circuits (crystal oscillator, filter capacitors, voltage divider resistors, etc.). The software logic implements dual-channel alternating sampling, linear calibration of data (formula: Voltage = ADC raw value × 5.0 / 255), and dynamic refresh display (updated at least twice per second). The system supports independent voltage measurements for two channels with an accuracy of ±0.1V, making it suitable for scenarios such as battery monitoring and sensor signal acquisition.
