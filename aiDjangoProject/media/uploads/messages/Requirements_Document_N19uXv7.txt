# PM2.5 Air Quality Monitoring System Requirements Document

## 1. System Overview

This system is designed based on the 51 microcontroller to achieve real-time monitoring and alarm functions for PM2.5 concentration. The system collects sensor data via ADC0832, displays concentration values and alarm thresholds on an LCD1602, and provides three-level LED indication, buzzer alarm, and relay control according to concentration levels.

### Main Functions:
- Real-time detection and display of PM2.5 concentration
- User-adjustable alarm threshold setting
- Three-level LED status indication
- Buzzer alarm and relay action when exceeding the threshold

## 2. Functional Module Requirements

### 2.1 Data Acquisition Module
Uses ADC0832 to read the analog signal from the PM2.5 sensor through channel 0. The system collects data every 2 seconds, taking 50 samples each time and calculating the average value to improve accuracy.

The acquired raw ADC value is converted to PM2.5 concentration by a simple linear transformation:  
`PM25_Value = (Average ADC value) × 2`

### 2.2 Display Module
LCD1602 displays two lines of information:
- First line: " PM2.5:    XXX ug/m3"
- Second line: " ALARM:   XXX ug/m3"

When displaying values with less than 4 digits, leading spaces are used instead of zeros.

### 2.3 Button Interaction Module
Three buttons enable user interaction:

**SET_KEY (P3^4):** Switches between normal mode and setting mode
- Press to enter setting mode; LCD shows cursor, Timer 0 stops
- Press again to exit setting mode, save settings, and resume normal display

**ADD_KEY (P3^5):** Only valid in setting mode
- Each press increases WARNING value by 10
- Maximum is 1000

**SUB_KEY (P3^6):** Only valid in setting mode
- Each press decreases WARNING value by 10
- Minimum is 0 (in actual code, set to 0 if less than 10)

All button operations have a 20ms debounce delay and a buzzer confirmation sound.

### 2.4 Alarm and Control Module
The system provides three-level indication according to the relationship between PM2.5 concentration and alarm threshold:

**Severe Pollution** (PM25_Value ≥ WARNING):
- Red LED on, yellow and green LEDs off
- Relay closed (JDQ = 0)
- Buzzer sounds intermittently at 1Hz
- Set alarm flag flag_BJ = 1

**Moderate Pollution** (WARNING/2 ≤ PM25_Value < WARNING):
- Yellow LED on, red and green LEDs off
- Relay open (JDQ = 1)
- Buzzer silent

**Good Air Quality** (PM25_Value < WARNING/2):
- Green LED on, red and yellow LEDs off
- Relay open (JDQ = 1)
- Buzzer silent

## 3. Hardware Interface Definitions

### 3.1 LCD1602 Interface
- RS = P2^7 (Register select)
- RW = P2^5 (Read/Write control, fixed to write mode)
- E = P2^6 (Enable signal)
- Data bus = P0

### 3.2 ADC0832 Interface
- CS = P1^3 (Chip select)
- CLK = P1^0 (Clock)
- DIO = P1^1 (Data input/output)

### 3.3 User Interface
- SET_KEY = P3^4
- ADD_KEY = P3^5
- SUB_KEY = P3^6
- BUZZ = P3^7 (Buzzer, low level sounds)

### 3.4 Indication and Control Interface
- LED_RED = P2^2 (Lights up at low level)
- LED_YELLOW = P2^1 (Lights up at low level)
- LED_GREEN = P2^0 (Lights up at low level)
- JDQ = P2^4 (Relay, closes at low level)

## 4. System Timing Control

### 4.1 Timer Configuration
- Timer 0: TH0=0x3c, TL0=0xb0, controls sampling timing; triggers sampling flag every 20 interrupts (about 2 seconds)
- Timer 1: TH1=0x3c, TL1=0xb0, controls buzzer alarm rhythm; toggles buzzer state every 10 interrupts

### 4.2 Workflow
1. System initialization: LCD initialization, timer configuration, display initial interface
2. Main loop:
   - Check sampling flag, perform PM2.5 detection
   - Button scan and processing
   - Alarm status processing
3. Interrupt service: Timer interrupt controls sampling timing and alarm rhythm

## 5. System Parameters

### 5.1 Default Settings
- Initial alarm threshold: 200 ug/m³
- Sampling period: 2 seconds
- Sampling count: 50 times average
- Button debounce time: 20ms

### 5.2 User Adjustable Parameters
- Alarm threshold range: 0-1000 ug/m³
- Adjustment step: 10 ug/m³
